Welcome to the Ball Picking Game website! This is a simple and engaging game where you, the user, and the computer take turns picking balls from a bucket. The goal is to avoid being the last one to pick a ball, as that's the player who loses the game. Here's how it works:


## How to Play

- Start with a certain number of balls in the pile. In this version, we have 21 balls.
- You and the computer will take turns picking balls from the bucket.
- On your turn, you can pick between 1 and 4 balls.
- The computer will then make its pick based on a strategic algorithm.
- The game continues until there are no more balls in the bucket.
- The player who is forced to pick the last ball loses the game.
